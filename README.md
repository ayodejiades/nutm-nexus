# NUTM Nexus

[![Vercel Deployment Status](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com) <!-- Optional: Replace with your actual Vercel deployment badge if desired -->

A simple, modern web application built with Next.js to serve as a centralized hub for accessing course materials and resources at NUTM. It uses a GitHub repository as its data source, keeping things lightweight and free.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** LTS version recommended (e.g., v18 or v20). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** or **yarn:** Package manager (comes with Node.js).
*   **Git:** Version control system. [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **GitHub Account:** To clone the repository and generate an access token.
*   **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):** Required for the application to fetch data from your GitHub repository via the API.
    *   Generate a **Classic Token** from GitHub Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic).
    *   Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `nutm-nexus-local-dev`).
    *   Set an expiration date (recommended).
    *   Select the **`repo`** scope (required to read repository content, works for both public and private repos).
    *   **Copy the generated token immediately** - you won't see it again.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/nutm-nexus.git
    cd nutm-nexus
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

The application requires certain environment variables to connect to the GitHub API.

1.  **Create a `.env.local` file** in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Add the following variables**, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```bash
    # .env.local (This file should be in your .gitignore!)

    # --- GitHub API Access (Required for fetching course data) ---
    # Your GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic, with 'repo' scope)
    GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_YOUR_COPIED_GITHUB_PAT_HERE

    # Your GitHub username (the owner of the repository)
    GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>

    # The exact name of this repository on GitHub
    GITHUB_REPO_NAME=nutm-nexus

    # --- Authentication Variables (NOT NEEDED - Auth Removed) ---
    # GITHUB_ID=...
    # GITHUB_SECRET=...
    # NEXTAUTH_URL=...
    # NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
    ```
3.  **IMPORTANT:** Ensure `.env.local` is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing secrets.

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üì¶ Content Management

Course content is managed directly within this GitHub repository in the `/courses` directory.

1.  **Directory Structure:**
    *   Create a subdirectory inside `/courses` for each course, typically using the course code (e.g., `/courses/csc101`).
2.  **Metadata:**
    *   Inside each course directory, create a `metadata.json` file.
    *   This file **must** contain at least:
        *   `title` (string): Full course title.
        *   `code` (string): The course code (e.g., "CSC101").
        *   `description` (string): A brief course description.
    *   It **should** also contain (for filtering/display):
        *   `department` (string): e.g., "Computer Science".
        *   `level` (number): e.g., 100, 200, 300.
        *   `credits` (number): e.g., 3.
    *   **Optional** fields:
        *   `instructor` (string): Instructor's name.
        *   `youtubePlaylistId` (string): The ID of a YouTube playlist for the course.
        *   `moodleCourseUrl` (string): Direct link to the Moodle course page.
        *   `moodleForumUrl` (string): Direct link to the Moodle forum.
        *   `moodleAssignmentsUrl` (string): Direct link to Moodle assignments.
    *   **Example `metadata.json`:**
        ```json
        {
          "title": "Introduction to Programming",
          "code": "CSC101",
          "description": "Fundamental concepts of programming using Python.",
          "department": "Computer Science",
          "level": 100,
          "credits": 3,
          "instructor": "Prof. Turing",
          "youtubePlaylistId": "PL..."
        }
        ```
3.  **Resource Files:**
    *   Place actual resource files (PDFs, DOCX, lecture notes, images, etc.) directly inside the corresponding course directory (e.g., `/courses/csc101/lecture1.pdf`).
4.  **Updating Content:**
    *   Edit `metadata.json` or add/update/delete resource files locally.
    *   Commit and push the changes to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository.
    *   The changes will be fetched by the API (subject to caching/revalidation) and reflected on the deployed website.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  **Import Project:** Import your GitHub repository into Vercel.
2.  **Framework Preset:** Vercel should detect "Next.js".
3.  **Environment Variables:** Configure the **exact same** environment variables on Vercel as listed for `.env.local` (under Project Settings -> Environment Variables):
    *   `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    *   `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER`
    *   `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`
    *   Ensure they are set for the **Production** environment.
4.  **Deploy:** Click "Deploy". Vercel will build and deploy your site.
5.  **Automatic Deployments:** Pushing to the connected GitHub branch (usually `main`) will automatically trigger new deployments on Vercel.
